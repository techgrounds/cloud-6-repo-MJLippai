# Data types and comments
Data types help a computer to understand how to process data so that the intended result is achieved. 
Examples of types are integers, strings, booleans and floats.

## Exercise 1  

Create a new script.
Copy the code below into your script.
a = 'int'
b = 7
c = False
d = "18.5"
Determine the data types of all four variables (a, b, c, d) using a built in function.
Make a new variable x and give it the value b + d. Print the value of x. This will raise an error. Fix it so that print(x) prints a float.
Write a comment above every line of code that tells the reader what is going on in your script.

## Exercise 2  

Create a new script.
Use the input() function to get input from the user. Store that input in a variable.
Find out what data type the output of input() is. See if it is different for different kinds of input (numbers, words, etc.).
