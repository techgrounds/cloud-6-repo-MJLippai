# Loops
Way of executing a particular operation a number of times. There are various ways to loop.
There are for, while and nested loops. Luckily in python these can be used in a fairly intuitive way.

## Exercise 1  

Create a new script.
Create a variable x and give it the value 0.
Use a while loop to print the value of x in every iteration of the loop. After printing, the value of x should increase by 1. The loop should run as long as x is smaller than or equal to 10.

## Exercise 2  

Create a new script.
Copy the code below into your script.
for i in range(10):
    # do something here
Print the value of i in the for loop. You did not manually assign a value to i. Figure out how its value is determined.
Add a variable x with value 5 at the top of your script.
Using the for loop, print the value of x multiplied by the value of i, for up to 50 iterations.

## Exercise 3   

Create a new script.
Copy the array below into your script.
arr = ["Coen", "Casper", "Joshua", "Abdessamad", "Saskia"]
Use a for loop to loop over the array. Print every name individually.
