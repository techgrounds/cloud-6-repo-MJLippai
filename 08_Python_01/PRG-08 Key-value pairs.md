## Exercise 1

Create a new script.

Key             -       Value

Last name       -       Meulenkamp
Job title       -       Learning Coach

Loop over the dictionary and print every key-value pair in the terminal.

## Exercise 2

Use user input to ask for their information (first name, last name, job title, company). Store the information in a dictionary.
Write the information to a csv file (comma-separated values). The data should not be overwritten when you run the script multiple times.
