## Description
Elaborate on your considerations. Describe your decisions and the reasoning behind them. This document should also contain your assumptions and improvements. This should
be the basis for your Design documentation.

## Deliverable

Assumptions have been provide in the exploration epic : [Assumptions](../Exploration/02_Assumptions.md)

The following are a number of decisions that were made during the development of the IAC:  

    -   Setting up logical modules based on grouped dependencies
    -   Networking : declare subnets, nsg rules and peering seperately as a child resources to avoid circular dependency detection.
    -   Key Vault : declare Access policies and key seperately as a child resource to avoid circular dependency detection.
    -   Make use of deployment script resource to automate uploading of the bootstrap script.
    -   Use of 'sym_link' naming convention to indicate a symbolic bicep name.
    -   Use of an 'environment' parameter to indicate whether it is a test or production environment.
    -   Use of of Userdata for the Linux VM server launch instead of an 'extensions' resource as said resorce would
        succesfully install correct packages only 50% of the time.
    -   Bootstrap script is loaded into Userdata during deployment from same file that is uploaded to the storage account as this 
        requires providing less access than referencing the file from the storage account with a url (providinng storage account access keys etc).
    -   Order of deployment is decided in part implicitly and explicitly. Reasons is strictly decided based on what is dependent on
        another resource in other to go live. This is further illustrated in the Design document and in the order of deployment diagram.
