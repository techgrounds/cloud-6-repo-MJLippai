Getting familiar with Bicep through Azure documentation and videos.

## - Challenges -
Zero experience with Bicep.

## - Solutions -
Study and experiment.

## - Learnings -  
Behind the scenes, Resource Manager still operates based on the same JSON templates. Bicep is simply a more declarative way of writing the same IAC ARM templates.    Setup of VS with necessary plugins complete, as well as instelled Bicep through Powershell to be able to use it via the terminal.

## - Challenges -
Converting ARM templates from Portal with json to bicep. Learning to clean up the differences/errors not handled by decompilation.  

## - Solutions -
Trial and error.  

## - Learnings -
The way Azure ARM templates appear in the portal are not the same templates you can use to deploy them. Many changes need to be made.  
Comparing available basic templates from bicep github and azure quickstarts with the templates from the live versions can help solve the adjustments needed.

Focusing on dependencies and how to avoid circular dependency detection by breaking up resources into child sources.

## - Challenges -
There are various ways of referencing a parent/child or having to take dependencies into account when building IAC.

## - Solutions -
Going through Azure documentation to figure out ways of using parent/child resources or setting dependenies explicitly to ensure resources are launched in correct order.   

## - Learnings -
How to make use of parent child resources to avoid errors or simply make code more readable.

Working on Network segment of IAC. Making sure all components work. 

## - Challenges -
Peerings can cause circular dependeny with the way they are shown in the ARM template from Portal (live resources).  

## - Solutions -
Comparing template codes with live versions. Breaking up resources to avoid depencies.  
Quite a bit of duplicate code in live versions that was unneeded so lot of cleaning up.  

## - Learnings -
Making more use of parameters and how to set up specific resources. In this case related to Network mostly.

Figuring out a solution for using user assigned identities to get around our restrictions with AD to be able to make Storage account (and VMs) encrypted with cmk.

## - Challenges -
Was not at first clear how to get around not using AD.

## - Solutions -
With assistance from LearningCoach we tested some options with User assigned identities to resolve the requirements of deployment of said resources.

## - Learnings -
Usually multiple ways of solving issues, when limitations are involved.

Trying to find a way to upload a script to a storageaccount as part of the bicep deployment.

## - Challenges -
There are limited ways to accomplish this during bicep deployment as you must run Azure CLI or Powershell commands to make this possible.  

## - Solutions -
Solution found on a github source. Deployment scripts combined with syntax within that allows you to load the file as base64 (otherwise  
the spaces were being lost, and Custom script can directly use a bootstrap script if in base64 encoding).

Finalizing the modularization layout to start splitting up the main code. Testing use of outputs and going through documentation.

## - Challenges -
Deciding what modules and resources to group. 

## - Solutions -
Checking working IAC examples to see how people implement best practices related to these concepts.

## - Learnings -
Groupings based on dependencies results in limited outputs needing to be generated later on while still being very useful on regards to clarity and possibly further modularization.

Focusing on error generated when trying to make use of the encryptionset.

## - Challenges -
Keey keeps giving an error related to keyvault access.  


## - Solutions -
Checking documentation, other similar reports. Comparing similar templates to my syntax. 

## - Learnings -

Aside from Access policies, keys themselves also have specific operations set on creation which depict what they are allowed to be used for.  
This was previoudly not clear from any examples found.

Finished creating recovery module. Finished some outstanding tasks for network. Various tests made, focuses on network restrictions but also with completed IAC. Everything seems to be working.

## - Challenges -
Beckup items need to be defined in a very specific way (to illustrate their particular child status), however the learnings so far provided to translate very well to developing the recovery vault and it deployed first try.

## - Solutions -
Apply previous learnings to recovery vault and use bicep documentation for backup items.

## - Learnings -
How to declare the backup items in with correct naming convention.
