# Azure App Configuration
A centrazlized service to manage application settings and feature flags. By centralizing the management of the many components that make up the totality of your usage of Azure you can avoid various issues that can arise.

One key programming methodology that this solution provides is seperating configuration from code (Twelve-Factor App).

The following examples are the types of application that benefit from the use of Azure App Configuration:

    Microservices based on Azure Kubernetes Service, Azure Service Fabric, or other containerized apps deployed in one or more geographies
    Serverless apps, which include Azure Functions or other event-driven stateless compute apps
    Continuous deployment pipeline

App Configuration offers the following benefits:

    A fully managed service that can be set up in minutes
    Flexible key representations and mappings
    Tagging with labels
    Point-in-time replay of settings
    Dedicated UI for feature flag management
    Comparison of two sets of configurations on custom-defined dimensions
    Enhanced security through Azure-managed identities
    Encryption of sensitive information at rest and in transit
    Native integration with popular frameworks
